scratch
=======

Scratch is for writing random stuff.  Actually I just wanted something to test Markdown! :D

# What happens when headers are super long.  For example this whole line should be a header and it is a very long long line of text.   It even has sentences!  That makes it a paragraph my friend.

__Can I bold a whole paragraph?  Perhaps I can.  Let's write a whole paragraph!
One with multiple lines on the text editor.
This, for example,
is on
many
lines.__
